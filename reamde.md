# 🧪 Test-Driven Development in Go

Welcome to my journey of learning **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in **Go (Golang)**! This project is based on the amazing [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) by Chris James.

## 📚 What’s This Repo?

This repo showcases my hands-on practice with Go fundamentals through the lens of TDD. Each directory here represents a mini-project or concept covered in the book, fully covered with tests *before* code—because writing tests first is how we roll. 😎
